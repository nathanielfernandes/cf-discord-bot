# cf-discord-bot 🏗️👷 `WIP`

### A Library for creating 'serverless' discord bots using cloudflare workers

The libraries purpose is to simplify the process of creating cloudflare worker discord bots that interact with discord through slash commands.

## Progress

Have some basics done so far, still in development. <br>
A basic bot can be made however creating messages and accessing interaction options are not simplified.

`main.js` is the content of the example Workers script.

`commands.js` are the bots commands.

`./src` is where the library code is located atm.
